              Twenty states expanded Medicaid eligibility to low-income childless adults in 2014. Did this large and costly expansion of welfare attract these newly-eligible adults to expansion states? By merging administrative tax records, Medicaid enrollment records and survey data, I find that 4.7% of these adults move interstate annually, over twice the rate reported in the Current Population Survey. Nevertheless, both state-level and border-county difference-in-differences designs detect no statistically significant impact of Medicaid on migration over the first five years. These estimates are precise enough to reject meaningful budgetary or welfare costs or benefits from migration. In contrast, I find that the same subpopulation migrated substantially in response to Great Recession local shocks. This appears difficult to reconcile with the value of Medicaid. However, it may be explained by the fact that a newly-eligible adult gains less than 2 years of Medicaid enrollment in the 5 years after moving to an expansion state, or by the confusion about enrollment that I document in survey data. Regardless of the explanation, the welfare magnet effect of Medicaid expansion was negligible.

              We study the effect of incarceration on wages, self-employment,
              and taxes and transfers in North Carolina and Ohio using two
              quasi-experimental research designs: discontinuities in sentencing
              guidelines and random assignment to judges. Across both states,
              incarceration generates short-term drops in economic activity
              while individuals remain in prison. As a result, a year-long
              sentence decreases cumulative earnings over five years by 13%.
              Beyond five years, however, there is no evidence of lower
              employment, wage earnings, or self-employment in either state, as
              well as among defendants with no prior incarceration history.
              These results suggest that upstream factors, such as other types
              of criminal justice interactions or pre-existing labor market
              detachment, are more likely to be the cause of low earnings among
              the previously incarcerated, who we estimate would earn $5,000 per
              year on average if spared a prison sentence.

              We present the first causal analysis of a seven-year run-up of
              minimum wages to $15. Using a novel stacked county-level synthetic
              control estimator and data on fast-food restaurants, we find
              substantial pay growth and no disemployment. Our results hold
              among lower-wage counties and counties without local minimum
              wages. Minimum wage increases reduce separation rates and raise
              wages faster than prices at McDonald’s stores; both findings imply
              a monopsonistic labor market with declining rents. In the tight
              post-pandemic labor market, when labor supply becomes more
              elastic, we find positive employment effects. These become larger
              and statistically significant after addressing pandemic-response
              confounds.

              The rise of freelance work in the online platform economy (OPE)
              has received considerable media and policy attention in recent
              years, but freelance work is by no means a new phenomenon. In this
              paper, we draw on I.R.S. tax records to identify instances when
              workers begin doing online platform work versus other
              freelance/independent contractor “gig” work for firms. We find gig
              work occurs around major reductions in outside income, and
              document usage over the lifecycle. Our results provide suggestive
              evidence on motivations for entering into each type of work.

              [Awaiting new draft and general disclosure permission.] Health insurance availability may affect work choices—often referred to as “job lock”—and is an important determinant of health. The Affordable Care Act in 2014 expanded insurance coverage via Medicaid expansions and the establishment of subsidized marketplaces, thus weakening the link between health insurance and employment. We study the effects of these policies, exploiting variation in the timing of expansions across states and using rich IRS longitudinal microdata. The universe of tax records allows us to estimate precise effects on a range of outcomes, including earnings, self-employment, job transitions, mortality, mobility and tax filing behavior. We examine heterogeneity by insurance status prior to 2014, including low-income wage earners and the self-employed without spousal coverage who would have benefited most from the policy change, as well as by income, age and gender.

               We study the joint effects of the tax system, government transfers, and self-insurance in mitigating earnings losses from job loss. Transfer payments imply smaller income losses relative to wage losses; behavioral responses (asset liquidation, self-employment, income misreporting, family members’ labor supply) mitigate household income losses relative to worker income losses; and progressive tax rates imply smaller after-tax income losses relative to pre-tax income losses. We leverage a novel merge between social safety net benefit takeup in 42 US states to population tax returns and earnings data to estimate these various margins of response in a single dataset. In doing so, we will be able to integrate the tax system, transfer payments, and household responses into a net measure of household and government insurance against job loss.
